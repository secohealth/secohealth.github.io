<h3>Internatinal Workshop on Software Health (SoHeal)</h3>
<p>
   The 1st International Workshop on Software Health (<b>SoHeal 2018</b>) will be co-located with the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (<a href="https://www.icse2018.org/" target="_blank"><b>ICSE 2018</b></a>) in Gothenburg in Sweden.
   (<a href="https://soheal.github.io/">Link</a>)
</p>

<p>
  <b>SoHeal</b> aims to enable and promote collaboration between academia and industry, unifying the views on software health of researchers and practitioners. The workshop's goals are to: (1) raise awareness of practitioners' problems with software health; (2) familiarize practitioners with the progress made by academia; and (3) connect the two communities to further advance the body of knowledge and state of the practice on software health.

<h3>Peer Production Project Health</h3>
<p>
   The <b>Peer Production Project Health</b> minitrack (Openness in Research and Practice (SIGOPEN) track) at the 24th Americas Conference on Information Systems (<a href="http://amcis2018.aisnet.org/" target="_blank"><b>AMCIS 2018</b></a>) in New Orleans in USA.

<p>
  <b>Peer production projects</b> include open source, citizen science, or crowdsourcing communities, where the community is driving product innovation. Given the increasing strategic value of peer production for companies, defining and measuring health of peer production projects has become essential for community managers and other stakeholders. Healthy peer production projects should produce quality outcomes, be long-lived, and be self-sustained. Health is enabled by community growth, financial resources, and collaboration tools. An additional challenge is assessing and monitoring health within peer production ecosystems of interrelated projects. Relevant papers should investigate not only the definition of peer production project health but also metrics to measure health and the context in which these metrics should be interpreted. Furthermore, we are interested in the impact of health on projects and the whole ecosystem they are participating in as well as the impact of using metrics, for example, the potential for gaming the metrics.
