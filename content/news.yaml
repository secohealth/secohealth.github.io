  summary: | 
    Tom Mens co-edited an <a href="https://t.co/PhkjegJIWT">IEEE Software special issue</a> targeting the
    social aspects of software development.   
  content: |
    Contemporary Software Engineering has inevitably become much more social. Due to the size,
    complexity, and diversity of today's software systems, there is a need to interact across
    organizational, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic boundaries. Large-scale
    software development now implies active user involvement and requires close cooperation and
    collaboration between team members and all types of development activities. Members of
    software projects across all roles must communicate and interact continuously with other
    project members as well as with a variety of stakeholders, such as users, analysts, suppliers,
    customers, and business partners. This theme issue aims to inform software engineering practitioners
    about current trends and recent advances in research and practice of sociotechnical analysis and support
    for large-scale software development.

    <p>
    Four new research projects involving researchers from Wallonia and
    Brussels on the one hand, and researchers from Québec on the other hand,
    were inaugurated in Montréal by the Fonds de Recherche du Québec (FRQ)
    and the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles (by means of the FNRS). Out of
    140 declarations of intent, 60 full project proposals were received,
    and only 4 were selected for a duration of two years. Our SECOHealth
    project, focusing on the health of software ecosystems, is one of them.
    The principal investigators are Professor Bram Adams from Ecole
    polytechnique de Montréal and Professor Tom Mens from the University
    of Mons.
