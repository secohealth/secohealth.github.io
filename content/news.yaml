    Four new research projects involving researchers from Wallonia and
    Brussels on the one hand, and researchers from Québec on the other hand,
    were inaugurated in Montréal by the Fonds de Recherche du Québec (FRQ)
    and the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles (by means of the FNRS). Out of
    140 declarations of intent, 60 full project proposals were received,
    and only 4 were selected for a duration of two years. Our SECOHealth
    project, focusing on the health of software ecosystems, is one of them.
    The principal investigators are Professor Bram Adams from Ecole
    polytechnique de Montréal and Professor Tom Mens from the University
    of Mons.
